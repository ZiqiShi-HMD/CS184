UC Berkeley CS 184 computer graphics projects, Spring 2023

Report by Ziqi Shi, Buyi Geng

This is a repository for only the report documents. The skeleton code upon which the source code was built on is UC Berkeley university property and thus has been redacted. For access to the source code, please email me at edward.shi0528@gmail.com. For current students who come across this repo, I really recommend you work on it yourself as this is a fun course that you shouldn't really ruin for yourself with other people's code.
